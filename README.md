# Safeguarding in the Diocese of Aberdeen

## What is the Safeguarding?
Safeguarding is a duty that is rooted in the message of Jesus and in the mission of the Church. The Catholic Church in Scotland aspires to the highest standards with regard to the care and protection of children and vulnerable adults, and actively promotes justice for, and provides assistance to, those who have been abused.

## How To Run the App

### Step 1
Clone the repository to your local computer by issuing ```git clone https://github.com/lukemorrice/Safeguarding.git``` from your terminal.

### Step 2 (optional)
To run the app you will need to have the package manager npm installed. Details on installing npm can be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm.

### Step 3
Once you have cloned the repository and have npm installed, run ```npm install``` from the repository root which will fetch and download all the relevant packages to run the app.

### Step 4
If you would like to simulate on an iOS device, you should firstly ```cd ios``` from the repository root and run ```pod install``` then subsequently ```pod update```. You can then run the app by issuing the command ```react native run-ios``` from the repository root for simulating on an Apple device or ```react-native run-android``` otherwise. However, running on an Android emulator may require an Android development environment to be configured. Note that it may take a few minutes to build the app when you first run it.
